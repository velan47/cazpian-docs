# Agents Basics

Learn the fundamental concepts of AI Agents within the Cazpian ecosystem.

## What are Agents?
In Cazpian, an Agent is a software entity that uses an LLM to reason about tasks and take actions (like running a Spark job or querying a table).

## Core Concepts
- **Tools**: Capabilities given to an agent (e.g., Search, SQL execution).
- **Prompt**: The persona and instructions for the agent.
- **Data Context**: The specific Lakehouse tables the agent is allowed to see.
