# Control Plane vs Data Plane

Cazpian ensures data security and sovereignty by separating the control logic from your actual data processing.

## Control Plane
The Control Plane is managed by Cazpian. It handles the Web UI, API, and the coordination of your Lakehouse.

## Data Plane
The Data Plane runs within your own AWS infrastructure (VPC). This means your sensitive raw data never leaves your environment, which is critical for compliance and security.
