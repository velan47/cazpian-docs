# Billing Overview

Cazpian provides a transparent, usage-based billing model.

## How it Works
You only pay for what you use. Our billing is tied to:
- **Compute Hours**: Time spent running Spark jobs.
- **Catalog Usage**: Number of tables and metadata operations.
- **AI Credits**: Consumption of LLM resources within AI Studio.

You can monitor your usage in real-time through the Cazpian Portal.
